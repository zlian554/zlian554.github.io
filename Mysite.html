        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying computer science.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy spending time with my family, and cooking up delicious meal with my mother. I am a member of Chin Baptist Church of Greenville and like to participate in the youth group whenever I can. I graduated from <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/whhs/">Wade Hampton Highschool</a> in 2017 and spent a year in a technical college learning auto mechanic.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy playing soccer occasionally, and sightseeing. Fun fact about me is that I used to be able to write in <a href="https://www.omniglot.com/writing/burmese.htm">Burmese</a> but as years went on without using it, I can only speak and moderately read the language now.
